                      Establishing trust with the victim may be difficult during initial interviews. Victims may not
                      initially divulge key details due to fear.

                      In the human trafficking context, it is common to engage in multiple interviews as trust develops.
                      It is also common that there may be initial inconsistencies as a result of distrust or the
                      victim’s lack of understanding about the legal process.

                      Victims should be interviewed in a setting in which they are physically and emotionally
                      comfortable. Interviewers should offer water, avoid noisy areas or areas with heavy foot traffic,
                      and ensure that only essential people are present in the interview.

                      You will not be able to keep details disclosed by the victim confidential. Explain this at the
                      beginning so the victim will understand your role and not feel betrayed if you have to share
                      information with prosecutors or other government officials.
